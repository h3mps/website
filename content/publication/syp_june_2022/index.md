abstract: I estimate the distribution of wealth in Canada for 1990-2018 using the income capitalization method of Saez & Zucman (2016). The results indicate that while the top 1% wealth share rose from 15.3% in 1990 to 19.7% in 2008, the top 1% share has since fallen to 17.5% in 2018. Using linear decomposition methods, I show that while changes to the composition of assets in Canada can account for the increase in top shares over time, the large gap between Canada and the United States stems mostly from differences in within-asset concentration. Finally, I apply the concept of “synthetic savings” to decompose whether the fluctuations in the top 1% share were driven by changes in asset prices or changes to savings behaviour and find evidence that changes to savings behaviour across the wealth distribution correlate more strongly to the observed trends.
