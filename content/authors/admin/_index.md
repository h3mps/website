Welcome to my site!

My research interests are in urban, spatial, public and labour economics. Specifically, I am interested in deepening our understanding of important policies such as land use regulations, immigration and wealth taxes by precisely quantifying their impacts.

I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Alberta in the Department of Resource Economics and Environmental Sociology (REES) and am part of the Bridging Divides U of A team.
